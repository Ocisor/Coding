//Global objects in node JS include, 
//setTimeout();
//clearTimeout();

//setInterval();
//clearInterval();

//in JS, window is a global object
//so, window.setTimeout();

//However, In Node JS, the window object is not defined. And instead uses the object
//global

//This means that any variables created REMAIN LOCAL TO THIS FILE.
//This is unlike base JS where everything is global.
//Obviously this is better.
